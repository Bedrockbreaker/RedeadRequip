If you die and go to pick up your dropped items again, this mod will auto-reequip your armor, dyes, accessories, and inventory for you!

If an item is already in one of those slots when you pick up your dropped gear, it will attempt to move it to a different slot, or dropping it from your inventory as a last resort.

Auto-reequipping is toggalable per section of inventory (armor, accessories, dyes, social slots, hotbar, inventory, ammo)

By default, everything but the main inventory (excluding hotbar) is auto-reequipped.
