# RedeadRequip
A small Terraria mod which reequips your items automatically after you die and pick them back up

Comes with configuration options for allowing/disallowing specific sections of your inventory.
By default, the hotbar, armor, accessories, vanity slots, dyes, pets, mounts, minecarts, and grapple hooks will be reequipped.
