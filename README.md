# RedeadRequip
A small Terraria mod which will automatically reequip your items after you die and pick them up again

If an item is already in one of those slots when you pick up your dropped gear, it will attempt to move it to a different slot, or dropping it from your inventory as a last resort.

Auto-reequipping is toggalable per section of inventory (armor, accessories, dyes, social slots, hotbar, inventory, ammo)

By default, everything but the main inventory (excluding hotbar) is auto-reequipped.
